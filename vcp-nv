*** SDN (Software Defined Network) - decoupling of Management Plane (MP) & Control Plane (CP) elements from the Data Plane (DP)
	Only the DP exists in the Switching component
	CP and MP exist elsewhere
	In SDN, the central CP has a holistic view of the infrastructure.
	Microsegmentation - DMZ Anywhere (even at VM's VLAN not only at perimeter)
	
*** NSX Terminology
	Segment - logical switch/VNI
	Compute Manager - vCenter
	Distributed Firewall (DFW) - East-West
	Gateway Firewall - North-South

*** Overlay Network - a network created on top of underlying physical infra using tunneling between endpoints
	Underlay/VLAN backed Network - Physical infrastructure, does not need to know about the Overlay network
	GENEVE - similiar to VXLAN
		overlay encapsulation protocol, creates a DP tunnel, stretches network over L2 boundary, requires Jumbo MTU (> 1600 bytes) for the Transport VLAN
		TEP (Tunnel End Point) - host IP created by NSX-T, uses vmk10 & vmk11 
		VNI (Virtual Network Identifier) - "overlay VLAN", a network segment similar to VLAN/broadcast domain

*** NSX-T Architecture
	NSX-T Manager Appliance - MP & CP
		3 nodes required in production, MP is Active-Standby-Standby and CP is Active-Active-Active
	NSX-T Edge Appliance - DP
	NSX-T VIB (VMware Installation Bundle) - DP 

*** NSX-T CP
	ARP table - Guest IP, Guest MAC
	MAC table - Guest MAC, Host IP
	TEP table - Host IP, Host MAC

*** Transport Nodes - any hosts/appliance on the DP prepped with NSX
	check if prepped: esxcli software vib list
	nsxcli: get ?
	N-vDS (NSX vDS) - created by NSX-T Manager in vSphere < 7, requires dedicated uplinks
	Converged VDS - possible in vSphere > 7
	
*** Transport Zones - define span of logical segments
	when segments are tied to the transport zone on a host, all VMs get access to those segments
	Overlay type - supports overlay segments
	VLAN-backed type - supports VLAN segments

*** Edge Cluster
	Edge Node - on/off ramp for the overlay network
	Tier-0 (T0) - communicates with outside physical network via BGP/Static routing
	Tier-1 (T1) - tenant router
	ECMP (Equal Cost Multi Path)

*** BUM (Broadcast, Unknown unicast, Multicast) Traffic Handling
	Head-End Replication - in case of same TEP VLAN
	Two Tier Hierarchical Replication - in case of same/different TEP VLAN

*** Logical Routing
	each T0/T1 has 2 components:
		DR (Distributed Router) - E-W routing, located in every edge and host transport nodes
		SR (Service Router) - N-S routing, located only in edge nodes
	Route Advertisement - from T1 to T0
	Route Redistribution - from T0 to Underlay

*** Services
	DNS
		forwarding/caching
		splitting
	DHCP
		server (local server)
		relay/proxy (remote server)
	NAT
		Stateful (active-standby)
			SNAT - outgoing
			DNAT - incoming
		Stateless (active-active)
			Reflexive NAT - requires configuring NAT rules for both direction

*** Groups
	Static Inclusion based on VM Name, IP Sets, MAC Sets, Logical Switches, Groups, AD Groups
	Dynamic Inclusion based on Tags, Machine Name, OS Name, Computer Name
	
*** DFW (Distributed Firewall) - East-West
