*** Software Defined Data Center (SDDC) - virtualization of server, storage and network
	ESXi = hypervisor
	vCenter = SDDC
	vSphere = ESXi + vCenter

*** vCLS - vSphere Cluster Services

*** Management:
	Host Client - ESXi host web management console
	vSphere Client/vCenter - central management of ESXi hosts
		deployment - vCSA (vCenter Server Appliance)
			     Note: an appliance must be a VM
	VAMI (vCenter Appliance Management Interface) - port 5480

*** vMotion - live migration
	Compute
	Storage

*** Features of vCenter:
	Template
	High Availability
	Fault Tolerance
	Proactive
	Host Profiles
	Content Libraries

*** Minimum hardware requirements for ESXi:
	CPU: 2 cores
	RAM: 4 GB
	Disk: 8GB/32GB

*** Direct Console User Interface (DCUI) - network address & misc. configuration for ESXi host

*** vSS (vSphere Standard Switch) - layer 2 switching, upto 16 per host, default networking on ESXi host, requires configuration per host basis, no centralized management
	Port - upto 1016 active ports per vSwitch
	Port Group - group of logical ports in a vSwitch, upto 512 per vSS
		VM Network - default port group for VMs
		Management Network - default port group for vmk0
	vNIC - logical NIC of a Guest
	vmnic - physical NIC of a Host, aka Uplink
	vmkernel - logical layer 3 interface of a Host

*** vDS (vSphere Distributed Switch) - model/framework/template for an ideal switch, centrally manageable
	Features:
		Port Mirroring
		Port Blocking
		Private VLAN
		LLDP/CDP
		Teaming/LACP
		Ingress & Egress Traffice Shaping
		NetFlow

*** Storage
	Datastore
		SAN - iSCSI/FC
		NAS - NFS
	VMFS - allows multiple hosts to mount and write in same LUN
	Multipathing - Fault tolerance
	PSA (Pluggable Storage Architecture)
		Native Multipathing Plugin (NMP)
			Storage Array Type Plugin (SATP)
			Path Selection Plugin (PSP) - RR/MRU/FIXED
				# esxcli storage nmp device list
				# esxcli storage nmp satp list
	vSAN - Cache tier & Capacity tier
		Storage Policies - API/Tag based
		File Services - NAS (NFS/SMB)
*** VM
	Cloning - VM to VM, VM to Template, Template to VM, Template to Template
	Template
	VMware Tools - better communication between guest and host
	
*** Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) - provisions compute resource from a cluster of ESXi hosts
	applied on cluster basis
	Prerequisite: vMotion
	Modes: Auto & Suggest

**** vSphere HA
	applied at cluster level
	Heartbeats - Network & Datastore
	One host is Primary and rest are Secondary
	Host Failure
	Host Isolation
	VMCP (VM Component Protection)
		PDL (Permanent Device Loss)
		APD (All Paths Down)
	Advanced settings (changing default isolation address)
		das.usedefaultisolationaddress false
		das.isolationaddress1 192.168.1.100

*** vSphere VM Fault Tolerance (FT)
	Primary copy of VM ---replication---> Secondary copy of VM
	vmkernel service - FT Logging
	License - max 2 vCPU in Standard & Enterprise, max 8 vcPU in Enterprise Plus
	Reservation
	Admission Control - ensures resource reservation for HA in a cluster
	not supported - snapshot, vMotion
	EVC (Enhanced vMotion Compatibility) - fixing lowest common denominator in a cluster of hosts with different processors
	
*** Resource Pools
	created at cluster level, ensures CPU/RAM for VMs
	Reservation - guaranteed lower bound
	Limit - fixed upper bound
	Shares - ratio based resource allocation (similar to QoS in networking)
	
*** NIOC (Network I/O Control)
	available in Distributed Switches
	Reservation, Limit, Shares can be set for bandwidth
	Network Resource Pools - created on vDS and assigned to DPGs

*** SDRS (Storage DRS)
	Storage Cluster of Datastores - requires the datastores to be of same type, i.e. mix of SAN & NAS not supported
		I/O Metric Inclusion
		I/O Latency Threshold
		Space Threshold
	Storage vMotion
	VASA (vSphere API for Storage Awareness) - ablility of ESXi host to communicate with storage array to determine it's capability
	VAAI (vSphere API for Array Integration)
	
*** SIOC (Storage I/O Control)
	Limit, Shares can be set for storage access
	
*** Content Library
	local to a vCenter, can be published and subscribed by another vCenter

*** vApp - group of VMs, startup/shutdown order can be set per group
	
*** Snapshot - restore point, consists of Base Disk + Delta Disks
	vmsd file = vmdk file (disk) + vmsn file (RAM)

*** Updates
	vCSA update - vCSA management console (port 5480)
		Backup should be taken of the vCenter configuration before updating
	ESXi update - use Life Cycle Manager to manage the cluster with a single image
	VM Hardware Compatibility
	VMware Tools

*** Host Profiles
	create in the Policies & Profiles menu
	attach to a cluster
	check compliance and remediate if necessary

*** Affinity - rules that impose restrictions on which group of hosts a group of VMs can run

*** Identity Sources
	SSO Domain - should be different from the AD domain
	System Domain/vSphere SSO - default: vsphere.local
	AD Domain - integration over LDAP/direct
	
*** Performance Monitoring
	Parameters: CPU - %RDY (waiting time of a VM to get CPU cycles), RAM - SWAP, Disk - I/O, Network - I/O
	Tools:
		Performance Chart
		Skyline Health (CEIP subscription)
		ESXi CLI - esxtop (V = vm-wise, h = help)
		vCSA CLI - vimtop (k = disk, o = network, esc = main-panel, a = sort-ascending, d = sort-descending, h = help)
*** Security
	VMCA (VMware Ceritificate Authority)
	vTA (vSphere Trust Authority)
	TPM (Trusted Platform Module)
	SGX (Software Guard Extensions)
	
*** Misc.
	VM Auto Start
	Instant Clone
		Object Reference
	Lifecycle Manager
		Quick Boot
	ESXi Host Auto Deploy
	vCenter HA
	vSphere Replication
