*** Each host can have upto 5 disk groups each with 1 cache and upto 7 capacity disks

*** Object Based Storage - stores data as unstructured objects
        Object
        Component

*** Features
        SPBM (Storage Policy Based Management)
        All Flash Support
                Deducplication
                Compression
                Erasure Coding
        Streched Cluster - provides resiliency accross sites, requires RTT<5ms
        Two Node Direct Connect - ROBO
        Data At Rest Encryption
        vROPS Integration
        QoS IOPS Configuration

*** Fault Domain
        vSAN has Rack Awareness
        
*** Design Considerations
        Hybrid - uses 70% of the cache tier as read cache and 30% as write buffer
        All Flash - uses 100% of the cache tier as write buffer and reads are serviced directly by the capacity tier
        Hosts To Tolerate Formula = 2 * PFTT + 1
                                  = 2 * FTT + 2 (Mirroring Configuration with allow for active rebuilds)
                                  = 2n + 2 (All Flash Erasure Coding}
                                  = 2n + 3 (All Flash Erasure Coding with allow for active rebuilds)
        Recommendation for Scaling
                Scale Up - maintain balance across the cluster
                Scale Out - same amount as the existing hosts
